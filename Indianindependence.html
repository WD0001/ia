<h3>Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947, four of the ten Gurkha regiments 
were transferred to the British Army. The rest of the British Indian Army was divided between the 
newly created nations of India and Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary Force, which had been formed to 
help police Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded.[30] Headquarters Delhi and the East 
Punjab Command were formed to administer the area.

The departure of virtually all senior British officers following independence, and their replacement 
by Indian officers, meant many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their substantive ones. 
For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh, the ground-forces commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak War 
of 1947â€“49 (and the future third COAS), was first an acting major-general and then an acting lieutenant-general 
during the conflict while holding the substantive rank of major, and only received a substantive promotion to 
lieutenant-colonel in August 1949.Gopal Gurunath Bewoor, the future ninth COAS, was an acting colonel at 
his promotion to substantive major from substantive captain in 1949, while future Lieutenant General K. P. Candeth 
was an acting brigadier (substantive captain) at the same time.In April 1948, the former Viceroy's Commissioned 
Officers (VCO) were re-designated Junior Commissioned Officers, while the former King's Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIO) 
and Indian Commissioned Officers (ICO), along with the former Indian Other Ranks (IOR), were respectively re-designated 
as Officers and Other Ranks.

Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa's 
taking over as the first commander-in-chief of the Indian Army from General Sir Francis Butcher, the last British 
commander-in-chief of India, on 15 January 1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date India became a republic, 
all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the King's Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their 
substantive ranks.</h3>
